Contents of this folder:

- [reference_data/](./reference_data/) contains the "raw" micromagnetic simulation data
  which was used to produce Figures 2-5 in the paper. It was computed using the script
  `generate_data.sh` in the folder [src/micromagnetic_simulation_scripts/](../src/micromagnetic_simulation_scripts/)
  of this repository.

- [recomputed_data/](./recomputed_data/) is an empty folder. When running the simulation
  scripts in [src/micromagnetic_simulation_scripts/](../src/micromagnetic_simulation_scripts/)
  this is where the resulting output data will be placed.
